ESP 32:
The esp_now_Sender1_HC-SR04.ino and esp_now_aggregator_mqtt_ToRPi.ino files use the ESP-NOW framework to establish a connection between each ESP32 board. The message structure can be updated to allow for a many to one connection via ESP-NOW. The ESP aggregator takes in the data from each board and aggregates that data. The aggregator also connected and publishes data to the MQTT Broker hsoted on the Raspberry Pi4.
